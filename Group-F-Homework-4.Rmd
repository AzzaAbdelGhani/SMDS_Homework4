### Exercise 6

**The following investigates the consequences of not using a logarithmic transformation for the
$nihills$ data analysis. The second differs from the first in having a $dist Ã— climb$ interaction
term, additional to linear terms in $dist$ and $climb$**

**(a) Fit the two models:

$nihills.lm <- lm(time  dist+climb, data=nihills)$

$nihills2.lm <- lm(time  dist+climb+dist:climb, data=nihills)$

$anova(nihills.lm, nihills2.lm)$**


**(b) Using the F-test result, make a tentative choice of model, and proceed to examine diagnostic plots. Are there any problematic observations? What happens if these points are
removed? Refit both of the above models, and check the diagnostics again.**

*solution :* Let's fit the models.
```{r echo=TRUE}
library(DAAG)
library(lattice)
nihills.lm <- lm(time~dist+climb, data=nihills)
par(mfrow=c(2,2), oma =c(0,0,0,0))
plot(nihills.lm)
summary(nihills.lm)
```
As we saw in Lab4, we can see from the plots that the variabiliy is not constant and that we have an influential point (Seven Sevens).

```{r echo=TRUE}
nihills2.lm <- lm(time~ dist+climb+dist:climb, data=nihills)
par(mfrow=c(2,2), oma =c(0,0,0,0))
plot(nihills2.lm)
summary(nihills2.lm)
```
In this other model  we still have the problems we had with the previuos one.

Since we have nested models, we can use $anova$ to compare them:
```{r echo=TRUE}
anova(nihills.lm, nihills2.lm)
```
The p-value, based on the $F$ test, suggests to accept the second model in place of the first one.

Now let's refit the models after having removed "problematics points":
```{r echo=TRUE}
#removing Seven Sevens
newnihills<-nihills[-c(19 ),]
nihills.lm <- lm(time~dist+climb, data=newnihills)
par(mfrow=c(2,2), oma =c(0,0,0,0))
plot(nihills.lm)
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
nihills2.lm <- lm(time~ dist+climb+dist:climb, data=newnihills)
par(mfrow=c(2,2), oma =c(0,0,0,0))
plot(nihills2.lm)
```
The new situation still presents some problems in both cases, as there may seem to be a pattern in the residuals. This may be because, as we saw, the assumption of normality does not perfectly fit the data.


### Exercise 8

**Apply the $lm.ridge()$ function to the $litters$ data, using the generalized cross-validation (GCV) criterion to choose the tuning parameter. (GCV is an approximation to cross-validation.)**

**(a) In particular, estimate the coefficients of the model relating $brainwt$ to $bodywt$ and $lsize$ and compare with the results obtained using $lm()$.**


*solution :* 

Firts, we choose the ridge parameter k (or `lambda`) by using Cross-validation :  
```{r basic 1, echo=TRUE}
library(MASS)
library(DAAG)
#select lambda in terms of GCV error
select(lm.ridge(brainwt~. ,data = litters, lambda=seq(0.001, 1, 0.001)))
```

Fit model with the best lambda (=0.118) : 
```{r echo=TRUE}

#fit the Ridge Regression model: 
brainwt_ridge <- lm.ridge(brainwt~., data=litters, lambda=0.118)
brainwt_ridge

#fit the linear model
brainwt_lm <- summary(lm(brainwt~., data=litters))$coefficients[,1]
brainwt_lm
```

We can see that in case of the ridge regression both `bodywt` and `lsize` coefficients are penalized in favor of the intercept, due to the fact that Ridge regression is a penalized likelihood framework. 


**(b) Using both ridge and ordinary regression, estimate the mean brain weight when litter size is 10 and body weight is 7. Use the bootstrap, with case-resampling, to compute approximate 95% percentile confidence intervals using each method. Compare with the interval obtained using $predict.lm()$.**

*solution :* 

The estimated equation is : 

$$ brain.weight = 0.203442601 + (0.005661579 * lsize) + (0.02205028 * bodywt) $$
where : $lsize$ = 10, and $bodywt$ = 7. 


```{r echo=TRUE}
library(boot)
library(lmridge)
# Ridge regression estimate :
ridge.estimate <- coef(brainwt_ridge)[1] + coef(brainwt_ridge)[2]*10 + coef(brainwt_ridge)[3]*7
print(paste("Ridge regerssion estimate : " , ridge.estimate))
 
# Ordinary regression estimate :
new_data <- data.frame(lsize=10, bodywt=7)
predict.lm(lm(brainwt~., data=litters), new_data, interval = "confidence")


# Sampling bootstrap of linear model
lm_func <- function(x, indices) {
  d <- x[indices,] 
  lm_fit <- lm(formula=brainwt~., data=d)
  return(predict(lm_fit, new_data))
} 

# Sampling bootstrap of ridge regression
ridge_func <- function(x, indices) {
  d <- x[indices,]
  ridge_fit <- lmridge(formula=brainwt~., data=d, K = 0.118)
  return(coef(ridge_fit)[1] + coef(ridge_fit)[2]*10 + coef(ridge_fit)[3]*7)
}


# bootstrap-based confidence intervals using boot
lm.boot <- boot(data=litters, statistic=lm_func, R=1000)
ridge.boot <- boot(data=litters, statistic=ridge_func, R=1000)
boot.ci(lm.boot, type="perc")
boot.ci(ridge.boot, type="perc")

```




### Exercise 10


**The data frame `table.b3` in the $MPV$ package contains data on gas mileage and 11 other variables for a sample of 32 automobiles.**

**a) Construct a scatterplot of `y` (mpg) versus `x1` (displacement). Is the relationship between these variables non-linear?**

*solution :* 


```{r echo=TRUE,  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(MPV)
automobiles <- table.b3

#help(table.b3)

plot(y~x1, data = automobiles, main = "y vs x1 (displacement)",xlab = "x1 (displacement)", ylab = "y", pch = 19,col="purple")

```
The scatterplot shows curvilinear relationship between y and x1.


**b) Use the `xyplot()` function, and `x11` (type of transmission) as a `group` variable. Is a linear model reasonable for these data?**

*solution : *

```{r echo=TRUE,  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(lattice)
xyplot(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data = automobiles, groups = x11, main = "y vs x", pch = 19, key=list(rep=FALSE,columns=1,
                                                                                          text=list(lab=c("manual")),pch=19,points=list(col="cadetblue3"),
                                                                                          text=list(lab=c("automatic")),points=list(col="purple")))

```
Here $x1$ is displacement (cubic in),$x2$ is horsepower and $x3$ is torque. This plot shows that apparent nonlinearity can be explained by the two types of transmission so linear model is reasonable for these data.

**c) Fit the model relating `y` to `x1` and `x11` which gives two lines having possibly different slopes and intercepts. Check the diagnostics. Are there any influential observations? Are there any influential outliers?**

*solution :*

```{r echo=TRUE,  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model0 <- lm(y ~ x1*x11, data = automobiles)
par(mfrow = c(1,4))
plot(model0)

```
Residual plot shows no systematic behaviour but there are some deflection from normal distribution. Observation 5 ,15, 22 influential and 5 is possible outlier according to Cook's distance.


**d) Plot the residuals against the variable `x7` (number of transmission speeds), again using `x11` as a group variable. Is there anything striking about this plot?**

*solution :*

```{r echo=TRUE,  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
xyplot(resid(model0) ~ x7, data=automobiles, group=x11, main = "model0_residuals vs x7 (number of transmission speeds)", pch = 19,
       key=list(rep=FALSE,columns=1,text=list(lab=c("manual")),pch=19,points=list(col="cadetblue3"),text=list(lab=c("automatic")),points=list(col="purple")))

```
Here observation 5 is the only car which is manual and has 3-speed transmisson so we can say that our previous foresight was right, 5 is a strong candiate as an outlier.



### Exercise 11

**The following code is designed to explore effects that can result from the omission of explanatoryvariables:**
```{r DAAG_ex11, echo=TRUE}
set.seed(11)
x1 <- runif(10)                    # predictor which will be missing
x2 <- rbinom(10, 1, 1-x1)          # observed predictor which depends
                                   # on missing predictor
y <- 5*x1 + x2 + rnorm(10,sd=.1)   # simulated model; coef
                                   # of x2 is positive
y.lm <- lm(y ~ factor(x2))         # model fitted to observed data
coef(y.lm)     
```
```{r , echo=TRUE}
y.lm2 <- lm(y ~ x1 + factor(x2))   # correct model
coef(y.lm2)
```
**What  happens  if x_2 is  generated  according  to x_2 <- rbinom(10, 1, x1)? x_2 <- rbinom(10, 1, .5)?**
*solution : *
```{r , echo=TRUE}
x2 <- rbinom(10, 1, x1) 
y.lm3 <- lm(y ~ x1 + factor(x2)) 
coef(y.lm3)
```

```{r , echo=TRUE}
x2 <- rbinom(10, 1, .5) 
y.lm4 <- lm(y ~ x1 + factor(x2))   
coef(y.lm4)
```
In both cases we have almost the same changes in the coefficients with respect to the correct model. The intercept has increased, and the other coefficients have decreased, which means that the effect of the variables $x_1$ and $x_2$ is reduced. We can also see the p-values of these two new models:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(y.lm3)
```
```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(y.lm4)
```
For the $x_2$ variable we have a high p-value, which means that the value of the coefficient $\beta_{x_2}$ is not significantly far from 0.


## Chapter 8 Exercises {.tabset}


### Exercise 1

**The following table shows numbers of occasions when inhibition (i.e., no flow of current across
a membrane) occurred within 120 s, for different concentrations of the protein peptide-C (data
are used with the permission of Claudia Haarmann, who obtained these data in the course of her
PhD research). The outcome $yes$ implies that inhibition has occurred.
conc 0.1 0.5  1 10 20 30 50 70 80 100 150
no    7   1  10  9  2  9 13  1  1   4   3
yes   0   0   3  4  0  6  7  0  0   1   7
Use logistic regression to model the probability of inhibition as a function of protein concentration.**

*solution:*

We use a generalized linear model with Binomial distribution. Since the logistic regression corresponds to the link function for binomial regression, we don't need to specify it in the code.


```{r echo=TRUE}
conc <- c(0.1, 0.5, 1, 10, 20, 30, 50, 70, 80, 100, 150)
no <- c(7, 1, 10, 9, 2, 9, 13, 1, 1, 4, 3)
yes <- c(0, 0, 3, 4, 0, 6, 7, 0, 0, 1 ,7)
n <- no + yes #total
prob <- yes/n #proportion, binomal probability 
plot(conc, yes/no)
model <- glm(prob ~ conc, family=binomial, weights=n)
summary(model)
par(mfrow=c(2,2), oma =c(0,0,0,0))
plot(model)
```
The fit seems quite good.


### Exercise 2

**In the data set (an artificial one of 3121 patients, that is similar to a subset of the data analyzed in Stiell et al., 2001) $minor.head.injury$, obtain a logistic regression model relating $clinically.important.brain.injury$ to other variables. Patients whose risk is sufficiently high will be sent for CT (computed tomography). Using a risk threshold of 0.025 (2.5%), turn the result into a decision rule for use of CT.**

*solution :*

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(DAAG)

str(head.injury)

injury.fit = glm(formula = clinically.important.brain.injury ~ . , data = head.injury, family = "binomial")
summary(injury.fit) 
#Observe that log(.025/(1-.025)) = -3.66, an increase of 0.84 above the intercept (= -4.50).

# Split the data into train and test sets
n_obs <- nrow(head.injury)
k <- n_obs*0.8
train <- head.injury[1:k,]
test <- head.injury[(k+1):n_obs,] 

#Fit the model 
injury.fit = glm(formula = clinically.important.brain.injury ~ . , data = train, family = "binomial")
#summary(injury.fit)

#get the probabilities of the predictions
probs <- predict(injury.fit, test)

# predict based on the risk threshold 
preds <- ifelse(probs > 0.025, 1, 0)


confusion_mat <- table(actual=test$clinically.important.brain.injury, predicted=preds)
confusion_mat
#print the accuracy 
print(paste('Accuracy', 1-(mean(preds != test$clinically.important.brain.injury))))

```



### Exercise 3

**Consider again the `moths` data set of Section 8.4.**

**a) What happens to the standard error estimates when the `poisson` family is used in `glm()` instead of the `quasipoisson` family?**

*solution : *

```{r echo=TRUE,  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(DAAG)
#help(moths)
#moths

summary(A.glm <-  glm(A ~ habitat + log(meters), family = quasipoisson, data = moths)) # taken from DAAG book
summary(A.glm <-  glm(A ~ habitat + log(meters), family = poisson, data = moths))

```

We can see that dispersion parameter for quassipoisson is 2.7. One of the explanation to this might
be there is a clustering effect with an average cluster size 2.7. Therefore standard errors and 
p-values from a model that assumed Poisson errors would be misleading because our assumption which 
is variance is equal to mean doesn't seem fair in this case.. Using quassipoisson has increased the
standard errors by a factor of $\sqrt{2.7}=1.64$. So using poisson will reduce the SE by this 
factor if the poisson family specified.


**b) Analyze the `P` moths, in the same way as the A moths were analyzed. Comment on the effect of transect length.**

*solution : *

```{r echo=TRUE,  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sapply(split(moths$P, moths$habitat), sum)

dotplot(habitat ~ P ,data = moths,  xlab="Number of moths (species P)",
  panel=function(x, y, ...){
    panel.dotplot(x,y, pch=1,type="p", col="red", ...)
    panel.average(x, y, pch=3, cex=1.25, type="p", col="blue")
    },
  key=list(text=list(c("Individual transects", "Mean")),
    points=list(pch=c(1,3), cex=c(1,1.25), col=c("red","blue")),
    columns=2))

# didn't understand why blue is still line even though I specified it as pch=3
#?relevel

moths$habitat <- relevel(moths$habitat, ref = "Lowerside")
summary(P.glm <- glm(P ~ habitat + log(meters), family =  quasipoisson, data = moths)) 

```
The highest numbers are in habitats `SWsoak` and `Disturbed`. Number of moths increases with the transect lenght, by a factor of $e^{0.55} =1.73$ for each one meter increase in transect lenght.



###  Exercise 6

**(a)  Simulate 100 Poisson responses using the model logÎ»=2âˆ’4x. Fit a Poisson regression model to these data, and compare the estimated coefficients with the true coefficients. How well does the estimated model predictfuture observations?**
*solution : *
```{r DAAG_ex6, echo=TRUE}
library("lattice")
library("DAAG")
x <- seq(0, 1, 0.01)
sim <-poissonsim(x, a=2, b=-4, seed = 21)
model1<- glm(y~x, family = poisson, data = sim)
coef<- summary(model1)$coeff
coef
sim_model1 <- poissonsim(x, a=coef[1] , b=coef[2], seed = 21)
mean(sim$y==sim_model1$y)
```
Predictons and real values coincide the 83% of the total cases.

**Simulate 100 Poisson responses using the model logÎ»=2âˆ’bx where b is normally distributed with mean 4 and standard deviation 5. [Use the argumentslope.sd=5in thepoissonsim()function.] How do the results using the poisson and quasipoisson families differ?**
*solution : *
```{r DAGG_ex6, echo=TRUE}
x <- seq(0, 1, 0.01)
b1 <- rnorm(1, 4, 5)
sim2 <-poissonsim(x, a=2, b=-b1, slope.sd = 5, seed = 21)
model2<- glm(y~x, family = poisson, data = sim2)
summary(model2)

```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
model3 <- glm(y~x, family = quasipoisson, data = sim2)
summary(model3)
```

We can see that the estimated coefficients are equal, the difference between the two models is the 
dispersion parameter: in the Poisson one is set to 1, in the quasipoisson is set to 15. We can see 
that this mkae the standard errors change in the two models, and so the confidence intervals and 
the p-values.

The highest numbers are in habitats `SWsoak` and `Disturbed`. Number of moths increases with the 
transect lenght, by a factor of $e^{0.55} =1.73$ for each one meter increase in transect lenght.
